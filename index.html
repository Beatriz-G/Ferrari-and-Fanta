                    <p>
                        Born who knows when and where, Ferrari and Fanta have overcome the
                        <a href="https://www.aspca.org/helping-people-pets/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics" target="_blank">sad realities</a> 
                        of shelter life. Two lucky senior girls that found their way 
                        to the warm welcoming home of Carla and Oscar, have 
                        had no trouble adjusting to the warm meals and cozy beds. 
                        Needing attention 24/7, Ferrari and Fanta bring 
                        their own unique zest to any situation. Planning on eating? 
                        Throw them a fry. Thinking of snuggling on the sofa? 
                        Bring them in. Will they bark at each other? Yes! 
                        Do they hate each other? Most likely. But deep down, they 
                        love to be in company of each other. ❤️

                        Ferrari (aka FerBear)
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        With a name like Ferrari, you might think she's fast and agile, 
                        with unparalled elegance like the luxury cars. This is <em>not</em> 
                        that kind of Ferrari. Chill, lowkey and a lot bitey, Ferrari is 
                        the type to like you, maybe hate you but will definitely <em>need</em> you. 
                        With thick, lucious fur, petting her is a treat. But our sassy girl has her 
                        boundaries and would like for you to ✨magically✨ know them. 
                    </p>

                        Fanta
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        A refreshing addition to any moment, Fanta is a bright, bubbly 
                        chilled drink! I mean girl, shes a chill girl! She likes to 
                        patiently sit on your lap and let you pet her adorable floppy 
                        ears. No biting here, no sudden boundaries to watch for.
                        Fanta is a ✨sweet✨ girl who has worked hard to let go of her 
                        social anxiety. Bald patch where?!

                    <p>
                        With both girls being seniors, their health is of upmost importance. 
                        Needing attention 24/7 to exist, Fanta and Ferrari also need to eat 
                        at every possible moment. Feeding time is extremely important to these 
                        gals, being late by a single moment will result in excessive barking.

                        Join us at 7am sharp every day for breakfast. And 5pm every day for 
                        dinner. A warm scoop of ground turkey and veggies will fill their 
                        tummies. Poopies will soon follow. <br> Ferrari requires her thyroid pills, 
                        so lets not forget those in each meal!

                        Attention

                    <p>
                        Both girls love to be pet as often as they can. Giving attention to 
                        these girls is crucial. Fanta may get anxious if she doesn't see anyone 
                        for hours. Her tummy acts up and she may share that lack of 
                        attention in unpleasant ways. Please pay attention to your pups, they miss you!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As with any dog, we proceed with caution. We have to always respect 
                        their boundaries and remind ourselves that they have limits too. 
                        Ferrari loves to be petted, but has her limits. She might not always 
                        know what they are, but when she tells you to stop, you stop!</p>
                        
                    <p>
                        Fanta is a little more shy and might not be as upfront. But she still 
                        likes her time to herself. Fanta is a quiet girl that enjoys having 
                        the sofa to herself, her bed to herself, and her food to herself. 
                        She might have had a rough past and might feel like she has 
                        to defend her territory often. For her safety and comfort, we must 
                        respect her alone time!
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        These girls come from homes that could not take care of them 
                        anymore. Shelters are no joke, and all we can do is be patient with them.
                        They finally have a safe space to call home, but they still need their 
                        ✨space✨.</p>
                    <p>    
                        Patience, love and acceptance are all they ask for.
