                    <p>
                        Born who knows when and where, Ferrari and Fanta have overcome the

                        of shelter pups. Two lucky senior girls that found their way to the warm welcoming home of Carla and Oscar have 
                        had no trouble adjusting to the warm meals and cozy beds. Needing attention 24/7, Ferrari and Fanta bring 
                        their own unique zest to any situation. Planning on eating? Throw them a fry. Thinking of snuggling on the sofa? 
                        Bring them in. Will they bark at each other? Yes! Do they hate each other? Most likely. But deep down, they 
                        love to be in company of each other. ❤️

                    <p>
                        With a name like Ferrari, you might think she's fast and agile, with unparalled elegance like the luxury cars. 
                        This is <em>not</em> that kind of Ferrari. Chill, lowkey and a lot bitey, Ferrari is the type to like you, 
                        maybe hate you but will definitely <em>need</em> you. With thick, lucious fur, petting her is a treat. But our sassy girl has her 
                        boundaries and would like for you to ✨magically✨ know them. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A refreshing addition to any moment, Fanta is a bright, bubbly chilled drink! I mean girl, shes a chill girl! She likes to 
                        patiently sit on your lap and let you pet her adorable floppy ears. No biting here, no sudden boundaries to watch for.
                        Fanta is a ✨sweet✨ girl who has worked hard to let go of her social anxiety. Bald patch where?!

                        With both girls being seniors, their health is of upmost importance. Needing attention 24/7 to exist, Fanta and Ferrari 
                        also need to eat at every possible moment. Feeding time is extremely important to these gals, being late by a single moment 
                        will result in abusive barking.

                        Join us at 7am sharp every day for breakfast. And 5pm every day for dinner. A warm scoop of ground turkey and veggies will fill 
                        their tummies. Poopies will soon follow. 
                        <br> Ferrari requires her thyroid pills, so lets not forget those in each meal!

                        Attention 
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Both girls love to be pet as often as they can. But the reality is that free hands are not always available to pet them.
                        Giving attention to these girls is crucial. Fanta may get anxious if she doesn't see anyone for hours. Her tummy acts up 
                        and she may share that lack of attention in unpleasant ways. Please pay attention to your pups, they miss you!
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Safety

                    <p>
                        As with any dog, we proceed with caution. We have to always respect their boundaries and remind ourselves that they
                        have limits too. Ferrari loves to be petted, but has her limits. She might not always know what they are, but when she
                        tells you to stop, you stop! Fanta is a little more shy and might not be as upfront. But she still likes her time to herself. 
                        Fanta is a quiet girl that enjoys having the sofa to herself, her bed to herself, and her food to herself. She might have
                        had a rough past and might feel like she has to defend her territory often. For her safety and comfort, we must respect her alone 
                        time!

                        These girls come from homes that could not take care of them anymore. Shelters are no joke, and all we can do is be patient with them.
                        They finally have a safe space to call home, but they still need their ✨space✨. Patience, love and acceptance are all they ask for.
