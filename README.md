<h1>Ferrari and Fanta Homepage</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>Ferrari and Fanta are two precious dogs that came from shelters. My sister adopted these two ladies from a local shelter, and has been taking great care of them since. I decided to create a website for them
  because I am their designated dog sitter. Whenever my sister and her husband go on a trip, I am ready to feed and pet these two girls. It was important for me to create this website because it allows me to practice
  my code on something I love. Pets are more than just animals, they are a large part of our life. I wanted to create a page that was personal and important to me. I found that in this project.</p>

<p>I have added sections for About, Health, Skills, a Gallery and how to Contact them. I designed this page similar to my portfolio. I really liked having a navigation and a website that stayed on the same page and
  decided to practice this layout again. Even though I had done this layout before, I had struggled with the CSS portion. I wanted to keep my h1 and navigation on the same line once it was on desktop view.
  I came accross a few problems, did I write the HTML right? Did I set up the CSS correctly? Did I add the right CSS properties? I soon realized that I had to make some small changes to my HTML and had to rewrite 
  the CSS I had. I was able to figure out this issue after taking it to Google search, asked several questions and practiced the code until it worked. Aside from that issue, I came accross a few others that were 
  less time consuming but none the less challenging. </p>

<p>I hope you find this website fun and educational. I also hope that it inspires you to adopt from your local shelter.</p>
